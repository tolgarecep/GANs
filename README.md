# GANs
- `adversarial.m`: Goodfellow et al., "Explaning and harnessing adversarial examples" argued that the linear part of the high dimensional deep neural network could not resist adversarial examples, although the linear behavior speeded up the training. Here's the implementation of linear explanation of adversarial examples.
